                    My team of employees have a good knowledge in grow health and selling vegetables.vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin C
                     Diets rich in potassium may help maintain healthy blood pressure, which can ensure overall good health. Almost three-fourths of the worldâ€™s production of vegetables occurs in Asia,
                     mostly in China, which produces over half of its vegetables. The area of world land devoted to vegetables has increased due to the potential income value from vegetables.
                     Commercial vegetable production is a high input and labor-intensive activity that needs a large labor force, from cultivation to processing, 
                     including hiring non-family members and a much greater reliance on humans in the production, processing, and marketing phases
